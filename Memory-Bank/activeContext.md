# Active Context: Event Planner CRM

## Current Work Focus
**Fixing TypeScript compilation errors in the server to get the development environment running**

### Recent Changes
- Project structure established with client and server directories
- Database schema created with comprehensive tables for all entities
- Server setup with Express.js, TypeScript, and PostgreSQL
- Client setup with React, TypeScript, and Vite
- Basic models and middleware created

### Current Issues
1. **Missing Route Files**: Server trying to import 9 route files that don't exist
2. **TypeScript Environment Access**: Incorrect syntax for accessing process.env properties
3. **Unused Parameter**: Health check endpoint has unused parameter causing warning

### Next Steps
1. Create missing route files for all API endpoints
2. Fix TypeScript environment variable access syntax
3. Resolve unused parameter warning
4. Test server startup and basic functionality
5. Set up basic API endpoints for core entities

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technical Decisions
- Using TypeScript for both client and server
- PostgreSQL for database with connection pooling
- JWT authentication with session management
- Socket.io for real-time communication
- Express.js with comprehensive middleware stack

### Current Status
- **Database**: Schema created, needs testing
- **Server**: Basic structure in place, needs route implementation
- **Client**: Basic React setup, needs component development
- **Authentication**: Middleware created, needs implementation
- **Real-time**: Socket service created, needs integration

### Immediate Priorities
1. Fix server compilation errors
2. Implement basic CRUD routes for core entities
3. Test database connectivity
4. Set up basic client-server communication
5. Implement authentication flow
