# Progress: SmoothGig (Event Vendor Client Portal)

> **Note:** Product pivoted from Event Planner CRM to two-sided **event vendor** client portal. Platform name: **SmoothGig** (`smoothgig.com`). Legacy code/comments may still say PortalHub in SQL filenames — that is historical only.

## Handoff — June 20, 2026 (night — session end)

**Stripe client pay = Path B (vendor-hosted Payment Link).** User confirmed SmoothGig should not use Stripe Connect for client invoices.

### Shipped this session
- [x] Product decision: Path B — vendors paste Stripe Payment Link; clients pay off-platform
- [x] Removed Stripe Connect OAuth, Express onboarding, in-portal Checkout, invoice webhook handling
- [x] Migration `013_vendor_stripe_payment_link.sql`
- [x] Vendor UI: payment settings + onboarding — Payment Link URL field
- [x] Client portal: open vendor Stripe link; claim-sent for vendor confirmation
- [x] Platform Stripe keys used **only** for Pro subscription billing (`011`/`012`)

### Before next dev session
- [ ] Apply migration **`013`** in pgAdmin
- [ ] Commit + deploy (user commits manually)
- [ ] E2E payments: Payment Link + P2P + claim-sent + vendor mark paid

### Suggested commit message
```
Use vendor-hosted Stripe Payment Links instead of platform Connect for client pay.
```

---

## Handoff — June 20, 2026 (vendor-hosted Stripe — Path B)

- [x] No Stripe Connect for client payments — vendors paste Payment Link URL
- [x] Run migration `013_vendor_stripe_payment_link.sql` in pgAdmin before deploy

## Handoff — June 20, 2026 (Stripe Connect OAuth) — SUPERSEDED

> Connect OAuth was built then **removed** same day when user chose Path B. Do not enable Connect or `STRIPE_CONNECT_CLIENT_ID`.

## Handoff — June 20, 2026 (end of session)

**User stepped away after committing US date format.** Session also shipped quote-contract reliability fixes, CSP iframe fix, and mobile quote layout (may need separate commit/deploy if not yet pushed).

**Production checklist before E2E:**
- Deploy latest client + server to Coolify
- Persistent volume at `/app/server/uploads`
- Re-upload quote contracts lost to ephemeral storage
- Confirm migrations `002`–`007` if any quote/contract flow fails (`008` + `009` applied)

**Next session:** Apply migration `013` → commit/deploy → E2E payments (Payment Link + P2P) → family UAT.

## Current Status

### Deployment Status ✅
- **Build Process**: ✅ Working correctly with proper directory navigation
- **TypeScript Compilation**: ✅ All errors resolved, builds successfully
- **Docker/Nixpacks**: ✅ Deployment pipeline working
- **Code Versioning**: ✅ Version tracking in place for deployment verification
- **Server Running**: ✅ Application deployed and running on production

### Known Issues
1. **MemoryStore Warning**: ⚠️ Warning appears in logs but PostgreSQL store is initialized (may be false positive)
2. **Session Store Timing**: PostgreSQL store initialized correctly, but warning appears before initialization message

### Next Priority Tasks
1. **Test Authentication Flow**: Verify register → login → protected routes → logout works end-to-end
2. **Fix MemoryStore Warning**: Investigate why warning appears despite PostgreSQL store being set (if it's a real issue)
3. **Implement Event/Client CRUD**: Choose one entity (Events or Clients) and implement full CRUD operations
4. **Frontend Integration**: Connect remaining frontend pages to API endpoints
5. **Error Handling**: Enhance error messages and user feedback

## Known Issues

### Technical Issues
- **MemoryStore Warning**: Warning appears in production logs despite PostgreSQL store being initialized
  - Store is correctly initialized before middleware configuration
  - May be a false positive from express-session
  - Needs verification that sessions are actually using PostgreSQL store
- **Environment Configuration**: All environment variables verified and working

### Development Issues
- **No Error Boundaries**: Client needs error boundary components
- **No Loading States**: Need loading indicators for async operations (auth has basic loading)
- **Form Validation**: Client-side validation implemented for auth, needs expansion
- **No Testing**: Unit and integration tests not set up

## Completed This Session

### Authentication Implementation ✅
- [x] **Backend Auth Routes**: Login, register, and /me endpoints fully implemented
- [x] **JWT Token Generation**: Token creation with user ID and role
- [x] **Password Hashing**: bcrypt integration for secure password storage
- [x] **User Model Updates**: Backward-compatible schema handling (name vs first_name/last_name, password vs password_hash)
- [x] **Error Handling**: Enhanced error messages for database issues (connection, missing tables, column mismatches)
- [x] **Frontend API Service**: Axios instance with base URL, token management, and interceptors
- [x] **AuthContext**: Complete authentication state management with login, register, logout
- [x] **Login Page**: Form validation, error handling, and API integration
- [x] **Register Page**: Full form with validation, password strength checks, and API integration
- [x] **Protected Routes**: Route protection with redirect to login for unauthenticated users

### Deployment & Build Fixes ✅
- [x] **Build Script Fixes**: Fixed directory navigation issues in build process
- [x] **TypeScript Compilation**: Enhanced build scripts with better error reporting
- [x] **Code Version Tracking**: Added CODE_VERSION and BUILD_TIMESTAMP for deployment verification
- [x] **Nixpacks Configuration**: Fixed absolute path issues in Docker build
- [x] **Session Store Initialization**: Refactored to wait for DB connection before configuring middleware
- [x] **Trust Proxy**: Correctly configured for reverse proxy (Coolify)
- [x] **CSP Headers**: Fixed Content Security Policy to allow Google Fonts
- [x] **Deployment Verification**: Build process now verifies new code is deployed

### Infrastructure Improvements ✅
- [x] **PostgreSQL Session Store**: Configured connect-pg-simple for production session storage
- [x] **Server Initialization**: Async initialization pattern to ensure DB connection before middleware
- [x] **Error Logging**: Enhanced logging for production debugging
- [x] **Environment Variables**: Proper handling of VITE_ prefixed variables in client

## Current Status
- **Server Compilation**: ✅ All TypeScript errors resolved
- **Build Process**: ✅ Working correctly, verifies code deployment
- **Deployment**: ✅ Application successfully deployed and running
- **Database Connection**: ✅ PostgreSQL connected and working
- **Authentication**: ✅ Backend and frontend fully implemented
- **Session Store**: ✅ PostgreSQL store initialized (warning may be false positive)

## Next Session Goals

### Immediate Next Steps (Priority Order)
1. **Test Authentication Flow**: 
   - Test register → login → protected route access → logout
   - Verify JWT tokens are stored and sent correctly
   - Test error scenarios (invalid credentials, network errors)

2. **Fix MemoryStore Warning** (if needed):
   - Verify sessions are actually using PostgreSQL store
   - If warning is false positive, document it
   - If real issue, investigate express-session initialization timing

3. **Implement First Entity CRUD** (Choose Events or Clients):
   - Backend: Implement GET all, GET one, POST, PUT, DELETE routes
   - Frontend: Create API service methods
   - Frontend: Update list page to fetch real data
   - Frontend: Create/update forms
   - Test: Full create → read → update → delete flow

4. **Continue with Remaining Entities**:
   - Follow same pattern for Vendors, Payments, Tasks, etc.
   - Reuse established patterns from first entity

5. **Enhance User Experience**:
   - Add loading states for all async operations
   - Improve error messages and user feedback
   - Add form validation where missing
   - Implement error boundaries

### Long-term Goals
- Real-time updates with Socket.io
- File upload functionality
- Reporting and analytics
- Advanced search and filtering
- Email notifications
- Testing suite (unit and integration tests)

## Post-Pivot: Event Vendor Client Portal (June 2025)

### Session: Product direction confirmed
- [x] Decided greenfield product model — reuse infra, replace schema and CRM UI
- [x] Confirmed two-sided app: vendor dashboard + client portal
- [x] Confirmed MVP decisions:
  - One login per couple
  - Shared login page with role redirect (VENDOR → `/dashboard`, CLIENT → `/portal`)
  - Invoice display only (no Stripe in MVP)
  - PDF contract + client acknowledgement (no e-sign in MVP)
- [x] Updated Memory Bank: `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`

- [x] Created `competitivePainPoints.md` — pain point → PortalHub response matrix + roadmap mapping
- [x] Updated productContext competitive table, projectbrief success criteria, activeContext north star
- [x] Key takeaway: link-first flows + mobile web portal + 30-second findability + 2-click pay (post-MVP)

### Session: Quoting workflow (June 2026)
- [x] `database/schema_quotes_addition.sql` — quotes + quote_line_items tables
- [x] Server: Quote model, `/api/vendor/quotes`, public `/api/quotes/:token`
- [x] Client: `/dashboard/quotes`, quote detail, `/quote/:token` accept/decline page
- [x] Flow: create quote → mailto/copy link → client accepts → convert to project → invite flow
- [x] Save as PDF (MVP): browser print on vendor quote detail + public quote page; server-generated PDF later

- [x] Confirmed current calendar is **read-only** (derived from projects/quotes only)
- [x] User wants **personal calendar entries** (payments due, off-book obligations, notes) — documented as **Phase 2 / migration `010`**, not MVP blocker
- [x] **Fix:** Quote contract PDF not attaching — removed broken `Content-Type: multipart/form-data` header (missing boundary); FormData interceptor in `api.ts`; relaxed PDF mime filter; rollback quote if attach fails
- [ ] User E2E test: new vendor full path (re-create quote with contract to verify fix)

### Session: Vendor product polish priorities 1–5 (June 2026)
- [x] P1 — Vendor command center: `GET /api/vendor/dashboard`, attention queue, stats, upcoming events, refreshed home UI
- [x] P2 — Notifications: `009_vendor_notifications.sql`, bell dropdown, Socket.io push, hooks on quote/invite/payment events
- [x] P3 — Transactional email: nodemailer service; send quote / invite / invoice when SMTP configured; UI send buttons

- [x] P5 — `/dashboard/settings` branding page, logo upload, branded vendor header with accent colors
- [x] User ran `008` + `009` SQL in pgAdmin

### Session: Product rebrand to SmoothGig (June 20, 2026)
- [x] Evaluated **Gigly** — rejected (gigly.com taken); user chose **SmoothGig** (`smoothgig.com` available)
- [x] `client/src/constants/branding.ts` — `APP_NAME`, `APP_NAME_PARTS`, tagline, domain

### Session: Quote US date format (June 20, 2026) — superseded by app-wide pass
- [x] Initial `formatUsDateKey()` in quote document + vendor quotes list

### Session: Product name — Gigly rejected (June 2026)
- [x] Considered **Gigly** — rejected because gigly.com is taken
- [x] Reverted UI/Memory Bank to **PortalHub** placeholder; `client/src/constants/branding.ts` is the single swap point for the next name

### Session: Product rebrand to Gigly (June 2026) — superseded
- ~~Official product name: Gigly~~ — reverted (domain unavailable)

---

## End of session — June 20, 2026

- **Portal contract iframe auth** — `access_token` query on GET; `ContractSignPanel` + `auth.ts`
- Portal **404** when contract file missing on disk
- **`docs/family-uat-guide.md`** for family testers

### Production lessons logged
- Mount uploads at **`/app/server/uploads`**; missing `contracts/` folder = re-upload or SQL delete + fresh upload on old server
- Blob iframe URLs blocked by **`frame-src 'self'`** — do not use for portal contracts
- Iframe cannot send Bearer token — query param or cookie required

### User actions before next session
- [ ] Commit pending changes
- [ ] Email family UAT guide with filled logins + quote/invite links
- [ ] Collect UAT feedback (mobile client portal priority)

### Next session priorities
1. Family UAT feedback → fixes
2. Payments E2E (deposit, P2P, Stripe)
3. Volume survives redeploy confirmation
4. ~~Stripe Connect OAuth decision~~ — **Resolved:** Path B
5. Register smoothgig.com + launch polish

### Session: Stripe Path B — vendor Payment Link (June 20, 2026 — night)
- [x] Discussed Connect vs vendor-hosted Stripe; user chose **Path B** (no platform Connect)
- [x] Migration **`013_vendor_stripe_payment_link.sql`**

### Session: Platform logo (June 2026)
- [x] Added `SmoothGig-Logo.png` → `client/public/smoothgig-logo.png`
- [x] `PlatformLogo` component — landing header/footer, login/register auth layout, onboarding
- [x] Favicon + og/twitter image in `index.html`
- [x] Tagline aligned to logo copy: "Book gigs. Grow business. Deliver smoothly."
- [x] Rounded logo frame + cyan/blue/purple marketing theme on landing/login (matches logo palette)
- [x] Marketing pages switched to **light background** (slate/cyan gradient, white cards, dark text) — June 20, 2026
- [ ] Optional later: icon-only favicon crop, email template logo URL

### Planned (user approved — implement later): Path B+ per-invoice Stripe pay URL
- [ ] Migration `014`: `invoices.stripe_payment_link` (optional per invoice)
- [ ] Vendor UI: paste URL on invoice create/send; helper copy amount + Stripe Dashboard link
- [ ] Client portal: pay button prefers invoice URL, fallback to vendor default from settings
- [ ] **No Connect** — vendor still creates Payment Link/Invoice in their Stripe Dashboard
- [ ] Full spec in `activeContext.md` → **Planned: Path B+ per-invoice Stripe pay**
